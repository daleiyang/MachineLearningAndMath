          Science is located at The Centre for Computing and Engineering - 245
          Church Street. Moriyama &amp; Teshima designed the new Centre for Computing
          and Engineering on the urban campus of Ryerson University in the heart
          of downtown Toronto, Canada. The building features a sculptural treatment
          of the Church Street facade that dramatically changes throughout the
          day as the sun and ambient light varies. At times reflective and at
          time transparent, the building is a distinctive symbol of Ryerson.
          The facility brings together a number of departments including Aerospace,
          Civil Engineering, Computing Science and Electrical and Computing Engineering.
          Design started in February 2002 and the facility opened to students
          in the fall term of 2004. <br />
